# Software Installation

All [Harp Devices](../protocol/whoami.md) implement the [Harp Protocol](../protocol/BinaryProtocol-8bit.md) to communicate with an host PC. The `Bonsai.Harp` library provides an implementation of the Harp protocol that can be used to interface with any Harp device. To get started: 

1. [Install Bonsai](https://bonsai-rx.org)
2. [Install FTDI D2XX Drivers](https://ftdichip.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CDM212364_Setup.zip)
3. Install `Bonsai.Harp.Design` using the [Bonsai package manager](https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/articles/packages.html).

## Device specific packages

A high-level interface will usually be available for the specific Harp device you are using. To install them, first change the package manager **Package source** to `nuget.org`. Then, in the search bar, look for your device by typing: `harp.<device>`. For instance, for the [Harp Behavior](xref:Harp.Behavior) board, you should find the following package:

The device nodes should now be available in the Bonsai Toolbox and you can start using them in your workflows. See [Operators](../platform/operators.md) for examples of how to manipulate and control Harp devices.
